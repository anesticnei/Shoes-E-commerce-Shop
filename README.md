#Shoes E-commerce Shop

This project is one of my first attempts at creating an e-commerce website. The website consists of an array of shoe objects, each with a picture, information, and price that are rendered inside a container. Users can browse through the shoes and add them to their basket, which updates the price accordingly. They can also delete shoes from their basket as needed.

While this is not a big project, it helped me understand the fundamentals of creating an e-commerce website. I learned how to handle and manipulate data with JavaScript, as well as how to dynamically update the user interface based on user interactions.
